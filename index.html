            In 2003, an FLL team was started at Edmonds Heights K-12. As the team grew, it was eventually expanded into FTC team 
            3805 in 2009. The team underwent a total of four name changes, eventually settling on Atomic Robotics. In 2015, there 
            were enough students enrolled in the robotics class that a second team was started, 9880 Aftershock. They competed 
            for a season, then the program shrank down again and 9880 was put on hiatus, not competing for another 7 years. Then, 
            in 2023, Atomic Robotics had enough interest and enrollment that we decided to split back into two teams. Aftershock 
            was revived, and half of the Atomic Robotics members decided to switch to 9880. 3805 and 9880 both competed in 2023, and intend to compete in 2024 and beyond.
